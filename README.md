# vkc

vkc aims to be more like a helper Vulkan library to ease integration Vulkan graphics into
your game.

This is work-in-progress.

# Build

* `make` - to build `libvkc.so`
* `make test` - to build testing program consuming the library `libvkc.so`.

# Execution

Prior to running the test program, make sure you download the asset binary file from https://github.com/haxpor/vkc/releases/tag/res-1,
extract it at the root level of the project, then run the program.
